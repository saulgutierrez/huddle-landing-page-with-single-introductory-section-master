## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Ionic Icons

### What I learned

Using semantic HTML5 markups

```html
<figure>Some HTML code I'm proud of</figure>
```
Align-self property and drop-shadow filter

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  align-self: flex-start;
  filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px #402e6c);
}
```
